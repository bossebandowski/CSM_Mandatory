These are the test cases that we used. Copy the code into the console input. Right now, only the first line of input is read into the program which is a java issue and not an ANTLR issue. All types of white spaces are ignored by the parser as per definition by the grammar.

#Test1

y := 1; do x > 0 ->y := x * y; x := x -1 od

#Test2

y:=1; x:=2; if x>=y -> z:=x; skip [] x<y -> z:=y fi

#Test3

a:=9; b:=2; if a<b -> b:=0; a:=a+a fi

#Test4

do true -> x:=x+1 od
